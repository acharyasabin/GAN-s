LSGANs - Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks
Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator.

The least squares loss function is able to move the fake samples toward the decision boundary, because the least squares loss function penalizes samples that lie in a long way on the correct side of the decision boundary.

Another benefit of LSGANs is the improved stability of learning process.


Wasserstein GAN
Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) proposes a new cost function using Wasserstein distance that has a smoother gradient everywhere. This model is proposed to measure the difference between the data distributions of real and generated images.

This network is very similar to the discriminator $D$, just without the sigmoid function and outputs a scalar score rather than a probability.

The discriminator $D$ is rename to Critic to reflect its new role.
